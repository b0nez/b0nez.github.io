            <b>New Orleans</b> is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. 
            The population of the city was <em>343,829</em> as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area 
            (New Orleans, Metairie, Kenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of <b>1,167,764</b> in <em>2010</em> and 
            was the <b>46th largest in the United States.</b> The New Orleans Metairie Bogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger 
            trading area, had a 2010 population of <b>1,452,502.</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The city is named after the <b>Duke of Orleans</b>, who reigned as <b>Regent for Louis XV</b> from <b>1715 to 1723</b>,
            as it was established by French colonists and strongly influenced by their <em>European culture</em>. It is well known 
            for its distinct French and Spanish Creole architecture, as well as its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage.
            New Orleans is also famous for its cuisine, music <em>(particularly as the birthplace of jazz)</em>, and its annual celebrations
            and festivals, most notably <b>Mardi Gras</b>, dating to French colonial times. The city is often referred to as the
            <b>"most unique"</b> in the United States.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>New Orleans</b> is located in southeastern <em>Louisiana</em>, straddling the <b>Mississippi River</b>. The city and 
            Orleans Parish <em>(French: paroisse d'Orl√©ans)</em> are coterminous. The city and parish are bounded by the parishes of St. Tammany
            to the north, St. Bernard to the east, Plaquemines to the south, and Jefferson to the south and west. <b>Lake Pontchartrain</b>,
            part of which is included in the city limits, lies to the north and Lake Borgne lies to the east.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Before <b>Hurricane Katrina</b>, Orleans Parish was the most populous parish in <em>Louisiana</em>. It now ranks third in population,
            trailing neighboring Jefferson Parish, and East Baton Rouge Parish.
